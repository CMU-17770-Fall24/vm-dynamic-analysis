# Project 2: Dynamic Analysis using VM Instrumentation

In this project, you will implement some dynamic analysis monitors for the [Wizard](https://github.com/titzer/wizard-engine.git)
Wasm engine.

You are required to implement the following:

1. [Instruction Tracer](docs/tracer.md)
2. [Malloc Profiler](docs/malloc-prof.md)
3. [Path Profiler](docs/path-prof.md)
4. [Cache Simulation](docs/cache-prof.md)

In order to enable grading, we enforce an output specification for each monitor that is expected to be met.
